/*
 * omniphony-helper.c - decode and render binaural audio in a process of its own.
 *
 * CoreELEC on this hardware runs a 32-bit userspace on a 64-bit kernel. The
 * renderer and its decoder bridge are shared libraries, so they take the word
 * size of whoever loads them - and that would be Kodi, at 32 bits. Measured on
 * an S922X, the same work costs roughly twice as much there: Dolby Digital Plus
 * Atmos decodes at 0.419 of realtime in 32-bit against 0.204 in 64-bit. The
 * only way to reach the faster figure without rebuilding the whole image is to
 * put the work in a 64-bit process and talk to it over pipes, which was
 * measured to cost nothing.
 *
 * So: this program reads commands on stdin and writes rendered stereo on
 * stdout. It owns no audio device and no clock. Kodi owns both, and a helper
 * that opened an output of its own would be fighting it.
 *
 * It deliberately does not use the engine's own `orender` CLI, which can
 * already do stdin to stdout: on Linux that binary depends unconditionally on
 * PipeWire, so it cannot be built without a PipeWire sysroot for the target.
 * This talks to the same C ABI and needs nothing else.
 *
 *
 * THE PROTOCOL
 *
 * Both directions are framed with a 16-byte header, so a reader can always
 * find the next boundary without parsing what came before.
 *
 * Host to helper:
 *
 *     "OMNC"  op:u8  flags:u8  reserved:u16  len:u32  reserved:u32
 *     payload, len bytes
 *
 * There is deliberately no presentation timestamp on the way in. The C ABI's
 * `orender_process` takes one and ignores it - the parameter is spelled
 * `_pts_us` - and the engine derives the timestamp it reports from the stream
 * itself. Carrying a field the engine discards would invite a host to believe
 * it was doing something.
 *
 *   OPEN  (1)  payload is `key=value` lines, one per line: `lib` (required,
 *              the engine to load), and `config`, `layout`, `bridge`, `codec`,
 *              `rate`, `decode_thread` (`on` or `off`; unset means on for
 *              TrueHD and E-AC-3, off otherwise), and `override`,
 *              `override_dir` and `effective`: a partial config the listener
 *              owns, composed over `config` into `effective` (see OVERRIDE
 *              below). Must come first. Unknown
 *              keys are ignored, so a newer host can send a key this build
 *              does not know.
 *   FEED  (2)  payload is input for the bridge named in OPEN, passed on
 *              as it is. For the Harletty bridge that is one raw encoded
 *              packet, exactly as it comes off Kodi's stream parser before
 *              the passthrough packer; for the PCM bridge it is the next part
 *              of its labelled PCM stream, a header and then samples.
 *   FLUSH (3)  no payload. Drain the decoder and emit any resulting audio,
 *              then acknowledge completion.
 *   RESET (4)  no payload. A seek happened: drop decoder and renderer state.
 *   CLOSE (5)  no payload. Tear down and exit 0.
 *
 * Helper to host:
 *
 *     "OMNI"  frames:u32  pts_us:i64                 then frames*2 float32
 *     "OMNS"  code:u32    len:u32   reserved:u32     then len bytes of UTF-8
 *
 * Audio and status share the stream; the magic tells them apart and the length
 * is always in the header, so a host that does not care about status frames can
 * skip them without understanding them.
 *
 * All integers are little-endian, which every target this runs on is natively.
 *
 *
 * FLUSH AND RESET
 *
 * FLUSH is an end-of-stream operation. It calls the optional `orender_drain`
 * entry point until it returns no audio - one packet's per call - emits the
 * final metadata and audio using the same framing as FEED, then writes the
 * `flush` acknowledgement. The acknowledgement therefore
 * means every preceding output byte belongs to the completed stream. Older
 * engines without the symbol still acknowledge, with a diagnostic that drain
 * was unavailable.
 *
 * RESET is deliberately different: a seek discards decoder and renderer state
 * and must not play the audio being sought away from. Never implement RESET in
 * terms of FLUSH.
 *
 *
 * OVERRIDE
 *
 * With `override=<patch>`, the engine composes the patch over `config`
 * (`orender_compose_config`) into `effective=<path>` - `effective.yaml`
 * beside `config` when OPEN names none - and the renderer is created from
 * that. Three files, three owners: the host's `config`, which this never
 * writes, the listener's patch, which nothing writes, and the composition,
 * which is this helper's. The engine composes in memory and writes the file,
 * through `<effective>.part`, only when it does not already say exactly
 * that, so it can be kept on flash: once composed, every later stream only
 * reads it, until the config or the patch changes what it says. A patch it
 * refuses writes nothing, and the renderer is created from `config`. The
 * file is there only while it is what plays: when the patch is absent,
 * sets nothing or is refused, this removes it.
 * The open acknowledgement then ends with `override=applied keys=N`,
 * `override=none` (the patch sets nothing), `override=rejected` (the
 * renderer is created from `config` alone, and an `override_error <reason>`
 * INFO frame follows the acknowledgement) or `override=unsupported` (an
 * engine without the symbol). A patch that sets the speaker layout drops
 * OPEN's `layout`, which would otherwise win over it; one that sets the
 * decode thread hands the choice to the engine's option (`live`) in place
 * of the codec default.
 *
 *
 * THE STREAM LINE
 *
 * An INFO frame reports what the stream turned out to be, whenever any of it
 * changes: `stream objects= spatial= channels= rate= hrir= brir= latency=
 * render= source_label= bed=`. `brir` is the room's state (`none`, `loading`,
 * `ready`, `failed`), `latency` the renderer's constant delay in samples at
 * the session's rate, `render` how the frames reached the headphones as the
 * session rendered them (`direct`, `cascade:N`, `room:N` - N loudspeakers -
 * or `speakers:N`), whatever chose it; each is empty from an engine without
 * its query.
 * `bed` stays last because the host reads it to the end of the line, and a
 * new key must not contain an old one, because the host finds them by
 * substring.
 *
 *
 * OUTSIDE A STREAM
 *
 *   omniphony-helper --prepare-brir <liborender.so> <out.room> <source> <size>
 *
 * reads exactly <size> bytes of a room-response SOFA file from stdin and
 * writes the prepared room (`orender_brir_prepare`) to <out.room>, through
 * <out.room>.part, carrying <source> in it: the host's text naming what the
 * room was made from, which it reads back from the room to tell whether a
 * room already there is the one the file would prepare. It prints one line, `prepared <summary>` or
 * `failed reason=<word> <detail>`, and exits 0 or 1.
 *
 *   omniphony-helper --prepare-hrtf <liborender.so> <hrtf.sofa> <hrtf.grid> <rate> <eq>
 *
 * builds the finished HRIR grid of the local SOFA set <hrtf.sofa> and keeps
 * it in <hrtf.grid> (`orender_hrtf_prepare`), as a stream at <rate> Hz with
 * diffuse-field equalisation <eq> (1 or 0) whose `hrtf_grid_cache` names
 * that file would at its start; nothing is built when the file already holds
 * it. It prints `prepared grid=built …` or `prepared grid=kept …`, or
 * `failed reason=<word> <detail>`, and exits 0 or 1.
 *
 *   omniphony-helper --describe <liborender.so> <size>
 *
 * reads exactly <size> bytes of a SOFA file or prepared room from stdin and
 * prints what it holds and which binaural stage takes it
 * (`orender_sofa_describe`): `described hrtf=yes|no room=yes|no …`, or
 * `failed reason=<word> <detail>`. It exits 0 or 1.
 *
 *   omniphony-helper --compose <liborender.so> <base.yaml> <patch.yaml> <out.yaml>
 *
 * checks a listener's patch without playing anything: it prints the
 * composition report and exits 0 (applied, or nothing set), 1 (rejected) or 2.
 *
 *
 * ON DEADLOCK
 *
 * This program blocks when it reads and blocks when it writes. That is safe
 * only because the host polls both directions and drains output as it arrives -
 * the topology already validated in the out-of-process measurement. A host that
 * feeds without reading will fill the pipe and both processes will stop.
