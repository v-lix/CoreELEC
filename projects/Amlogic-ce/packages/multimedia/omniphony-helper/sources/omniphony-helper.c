/*
 * omniphony-helper.c - decode and render binaural audio in a process of its own.
 *
 * CoreELEC on this hardware runs a 32-bit userspace on a 64-bit kernel. The
 * renderer and its decoder bridge are shared libraries, so they take the word
 * size of whoever loads them - and that would be Kodi, at 32 bits. Measured on
 * an S922X, the same work costs roughly twice as much there: Dolby Digital Plus
 * Atmos decodes at 0.419 of realtime in 32-bit against 0.204 in 64-bit. The
 * only way to reach the faster figure without rebuilding the whole image is to
 * put the work in a 64-bit process and talk to it over pipes, which was
 * measured to cost nothing.
 *
 * So: this program reads commands on stdin and writes rendered stereo on
 * stdout. It owns no audio device and no clock. Kodi owns both, and a helper
 * that opened an output of its own would be fighting it.
 *
 * It deliberately does not use the engine's own `orender` CLI, which can
 * already do stdin to stdout: on Linux that binary depends unconditionally on
 * PipeWire, so it cannot be built without a PipeWire sysroot for the target.
 * This talks to the same C ABI and needs nothing else.
 *
 *
 * THE PROTOCOL
 *
 * Both directions are framed with a 16-byte header, so a reader can always
 * find the next boundary without parsing what came before.
 *
 * Host to helper:
 *
 *     "OMNC"  op:u8  flags:u8  reserved:u16  len:u32  reserved:u32
 *     payload, len bytes
 *
 * There is deliberately no presentation timestamp on the way in. The C ABI's
 * `orender_process` takes one and ignores it - the parameter is spelled
 * `_pts_us` - and the engine derives the timestamp it reports from the stream
 * itself. Carrying a field the engine discards would invite a host to believe
 * it was doing something.
 *
 *   OPEN  (1)  payload is `key=value` lines, one per line: `lib` (required,
 *              the engine to load), and `config`, `layout`, `bridge`, `codec`,
 *              `rate`, `decode_thread` (`on` or `off`; unset means on for
 *              TrueHD, off otherwise) and `heard` (`on` to send HEARD - see
 *              there). Must come first. Unknown keys are ignored, so a newer
 *              host can send a key this build does not know. Answered with a
 *              status line beginning `open `, which says `heard=on` when HEARD
 *              may be sent.
 *   FEED  (2)  payload is input for the bridge named in OPEN, passed on
 *              as it is. For the Harletty bridge that is one raw encoded
 *              packet, exactly as it comes off Kodi's stream parser before
 *              the passthrough packer; for the PCM bridge it is the next part
 *              of its labelled PCM stream, a header and then samples.
 *   FLUSH (3)  no payload. Drain the decoder and emit any resulting audio,
 *              then acknowledge completion.
 *   RESET (4)  no payload. A seek happened: drop decoder and renderer state.
 *   CLOSE (5)  no payload. Tear down and exit 0.
 *   HEARD (6)  payload is an i64: where the listener is, in the microseconds
 *              the OMNI frames count, so from 0 after a RESET. The engine
 *              holds what it tells Omniphony Studio about each block - the
 *              objects, the meters - until the listener reaches it, so Studio
 *              shows what is being heard rather than what was rendered for
 *              the host's buffers ahead of it. Only after an open that said
 *              `heard=on`: an older helper exits on an op it does not know.
 *
 * Helper to host:
 *
 *     "OMNI"  frames:u32  pts_us:i64                 then frames*2 float32
 *     "OMNS"  code:u32    len:u32   reserved:u32     then len bytes of UTF-8
 *
 * Audio and status share the stream; the magic tells them apart and the length
 * is always in the header, so a host that does not care about status frames can
 * skip them without understanding them.
 *
 * All integers are little-endian, which every target this runs on is natively.
 *
 *
 * FLUSH AND RESET
 *
 * FLUSH is an end-of-stream operation. It calls the optional `orender_drain`
 * entry point until it returns no audio - one packet's per call - emits the
 * final metadata and audio using the same framing as FEED, then writes the
 * `flush` acknowledgement. The acknowledgement therefore
 * means every preceding output byte belongs to the completed stream. Older
 * engines without the symbol still acknowledge, with a diagnostic that drain
 * was unavailable.
 *
 * RESET is deliberately different: a seek discards decoder and renderer state
 * and must not play the audio being sought away from. Never implement RESET in
 * terms of FLUSH.
 *
 *
 * ON DEADLOCK
 *
 * This program blocks when it reads and blocks when it writes. That is safe
 * only because the host polls both directions and drains output as it arrives -
 * the topology already validated in the out-of-process measurement. A host that
 * feeds without reading will fill the pipe and both processes will stop.
