PKG_LONGDESC="The 64-bit process Kodi's object-audio codec talks to: it loads the Omniphony engine, feeds it whole encoded access units, and writes back rendered binaural stereo."
PKG_TOOLCHAIN="manual"

# 64-bit only, which is the entire reason this process exists. A shared library
# takes the word size of whoever loads it, so an engine loaded by Kodi would be
# 32-bit; measured on an S922X, Dolby Digital Plus Atmos decodes at 0.419 of
# realtime in 32-bit against 0.204 in 64-bit, and the process boundary itself
# costs nothing. The omniphony package copies this binary into the 32-bit image.
PKG_ARCH="aarch64"
