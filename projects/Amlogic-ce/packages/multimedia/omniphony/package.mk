# The fork rather than PKG_SITE. It follows the current upstream interfaces and
# retains the Kodi integration pieces that are not upstream:
#
#   - pcm_bridge presents host-decoded PCM as a channel bed, so the codec can
#     render anything ffmpeg decodes rather than only the formats the object
#     decoder handles. It supplies the original codec's source family to the
#     placement policy, and declares the Dolby and DTS families in its
#     catalogue, since the renderer takes every family but generic and pcm
#     from the bridge: both in the room, as the Harletty bridge declares
#     them. That default is the speakers' one; on headphones, the only output
#     Kodi uses, the renderer now places every family on the sphere unless a
#     mode is set, and Kodi sets none.
#   - orender_decoded_sample_rate reports the rate the bridge actually decoded
#     at: a host must name a rate before it has seen a packet,
#     and for DTS-HD MA the one it can name is the core's 48 kHz while an XLL
#     extension riding that core decodes at 96, so the codec opens at its guess
#     and re-opens at what the engine says.
#   - orender_drain renders what the engine still holds when the input ends:
#     what the decode thread has not returned yet, then what the decoder is
#     still holding, one packet's audio per call. The helper calls it from
#     FLUSH until it returns nothing and sends the audio before acknowledging
#     end of stream. The Harletty pin implements the paired bridge_api
#     method, which is why both build against the fork's bridge_api 0.7, one
#     minor past upstream's 0.6: a bridge loads only in a host of its own
#     minor.
#   - orender_hrir_in_use names the HRIR set the binaural path is convolving
#     with. The helper passes it on as hrir= and the codec shows it as the head
#     model, so a SOFA file the engine could not load reads Built-in; brir
#     once a measured room renders.
#   - Measured rooms. orender_brir_prepare reduces a room-response SOFA file
#     to the head orientation a session renders, once, when the room is
#     chosen (the helper's --prepare-brir), reading only that orientation's
#     responses through the fork's SOFA reader (v-lix/sofar, a git
#     dependency cargo fetches with the rest); a session is built on the
#     room's own loudspeakers, a prepared room's or a SOFA file's, ahead of
#     any layout the host names. orender_brir_state says where the room
#     stands, which the helper passes on as brir= beside the renderer's
#     latency=, and orender_render_path how the session renders, as render=.
#     orender_sofa_describe says what a chosen file holds and which stage
#     takes it, reading only its shape and geometry (the helper's
#     --describe), so Kodi can tell the listener before copying anything. A
#     prepared room carries the host's text naming what it was made from,
#     which Kodi reads back from it to reuse a room rather than prepare it
#     again.
#   - orender_compose_config composes a partial config the listener owns over
#     the one the codec writes, whole or not at all, refusing the keys the
#     host owns: the helper's OPEN override= and --compose. It rewrites the
#     composition only when what it says changes.
#   - render.binaural.hrtf_grid_cache keeps the finished HRIR grids of a SOFA
#     set in files the host names, one per stream rate: the codec names
#     hrtf{khz}.grid beside the staged HRTF set, with diffuse-field
#     equalisation, so a custom HRTF plays from the start rather than after
#     seconds of the embedded set. Kodi has the 48 kHz one built when the set
#     is chosen (the helper's --prepare-hrtf); another rate's is built by its
#     first stream. Another engine build rebuilds them.
#
# ABI 8 supplies the upstream height-tier labels, ABI 9 the NUL-terminated
# orender_source_label query, ABI 10 the decode thread (orender_set_option's
# `decode_thread`, which the helper turns on for TrueHD and E-AC-3) and
# orender_drain, ABI 11 the thread's live option and
# orender_output_packet_pts, ABI 12 upstream's heard_us, which this tree's
# helper does not use, and this fork's decoded-rate, decoder-drain, HRIR,
# room and override additions are ABI 13. Every optional symbol is probed
# with dlsym; major-version mismatch is still fatal. The build produces both
# orender_ffi and pcm_bridge from this same pin so the C ABI and Rust
# bridge_api stay paired.

PKG_TOOLCHAIN="manual"

# This feature is 64-bit whatever the image is. A shared library takes the word
# size of whoever loads it, so an engine loaded by a 32-bit Kodi would be
# 32-bit, where the same work costs roughly twice as much - measured on an
# S922X, Dolby Digital Plus Atmos decodes at 0.419 of realtime in 32-bit
# against 0.204 in 64-bit. So the engine, the decoder bridge and the helper are
# always built aarch64, and this package has two jobs depending on which pass
# is running it:
#
#   aarch64  build liborender.so, and pull in the other two 64-bit packages.
#            On an aarch64 image that is the end of it - everything installs
#            natively. For a 32-bit image, omniphony-bundle packs what this
#            pass built.
#   arm      compile nothing; install the configuration below, and pull in
#            omniphony-bundle, which installs the 64-bit side - from a pinned
#            download, or with OMNIPHONY_FROM_SOURCE=yes from the aarch64 pass.
