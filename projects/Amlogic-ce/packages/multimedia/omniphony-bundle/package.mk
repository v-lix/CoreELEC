# An Amlogic-ng image is 32-bit, but the binaural codec's engine, bridges and
# helper are 64-bit - see omniphony/package.mk for why. Building them takes a
# whole aarch64 tree: its own cross toolchain, glibc and the Rust target. This
# package lets an image build do without that tree, and has a job in each pass:
#
#   aarch64  build the three 64-bit packages, assemble exactly what a 32-bit
#            image ships of them, and pack it as
#            target/omniphony-bundle-${PKG_VERSION}.tar.xz, to be uploaded as a
#            GitHub release, with its checksum and manifest beside it.
#            `ARCH=aarch64 scripts/build omniphony-bundle`. This is also the
#            command OMNIPHONY_FROM_SOURCE=yes needs: it installs this
#            assembly, which `scripts/build omniphony` alone does not make.
#   arm      install that assembly into the image. By default it is the
#            uploaded tarball, pinned below, and nothing 64-bit is built; with
#            OMNIPHONY_FROM_SOURCE=yes it is the aarch64 pass's own result in
#            the sibling build tree, as it was before this package existed.
#
# An aarch64 image does not use this package: omniphony installs everything
# natively there.

  # The bridge and the helper are named here although omniphony pulls them in

  # be rebuilt - the bundle would pack the old helper under a manifest hashed
  # from the new source, or look for a bridge version that was never built.
