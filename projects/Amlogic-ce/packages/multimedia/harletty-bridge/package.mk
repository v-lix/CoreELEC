PKG_SITE="https://github.com/harletty/harletty-bridge"
# The fork rather than PKG_SITE. Its parent is the updated main branch, which
# now supplies the former fork fixes, source labels/families, Auro layouts,
# corrected DTS side positions and DTS-HD HRA decoding (including the examined
# lossy-carrier DTS:X 7.1.4 form), recomputes the bed fold of a DTS:X object
# the encoder panned into the bed from its position, inspects each E-AC-3
# access unit at most once, and builds releases with thin LTO and its TrueHD
# decoder from its own truehd fork, a git dependency cargo fetches with the
# rest. It also ships one plugin per codec family rather than one combined
# library - this package builds the Dolby and DTS plugins, and IAMF stays
# off - catches a decoder panic rather than letting it end the helper, and
# sends its own diagnostics to the host at the host's log level, so they reach
# kodi.log. Two fork commits are retained. One drains the final buffered access
# unit through every family plugin, which only the Dolby one holds, while
# E-AC-3 is still the codec in play, so a unit a switch of codec
# left behind is not emitted, and hands the decoded core back from object
# reconstruction rather than cloning it for every object frame. The other
# reports a DTS:X extension that never decodes. DTS keeps upstream's room
# default, which is for speakers: on headphones the renderer now places every
# family on the sphere.
#
# It compiles against the matching Omniphony pin's bridge_api 0.7, the fork's,
# one minor past upstream's 0.6 for the drain. FFmpeg patches
# 0005/0008 identify lossless DTS:X forms and 0010 identifies DTS:X carried in
# DTS-HD HRA before Kodi chooses a decoder; plain HRA remains on FFmpeg.
