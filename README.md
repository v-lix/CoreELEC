# CoreELEC p3i

This is a custom build based on the great work Jamal did with his [U3k line of CE builds](https://github.com/CE-Repo) and by proxy, [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-code), [avdvplus](https://github.com/avdvplus/Builds), and everyone else involved. p3i aims to continue the lineage of U3k by:
* providing a stable daily driver base for especially S922X-based SoC's (Ugoos AM6b+, FireTV Cube 2, ...)
* backporting significant improvements to CoreELEC and Kodi from upstream and other known custom builds
* ensuring full transparency in the development process (all changes are properly committed and comprehensible)
* providing significant performance improvements for complex UIs

p3i doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel, but ultimately, to replace the famous [CPM A14 build](https://github.com/cpm-code/xbmc/releases/tag/CoreELEC-Amlogic-ng.arm-21.2-Omega_20250302082815.A14) as a stable, well maintained, daily driver.

It's directly forked off of [U3k B11](https://github.com/CE-Repo/xbmc/releases/tag/B11), so its core is:
* Kodi Omega 21.3 with significant backports from Kodi 22 upstream
* Python 3.13.11
* FFMPEG 8.1.2

## Building

p3i builds like stock CoreELEC, with two things you need to get right: the build target variables, and the local source checkouts the core packages build from.

### PROJECT, DEVICE and ARCH

The build system picks its target from environment variables. **With nothing set it defaults to `PROJECT=Amlogic-ce`, `DEVICE=Amlogic-ne`, `ARCH=aarch64`**, so a bare `make` builds Amlogic-ne, not the Amlogic-ng (arm) images p3i primarily targets (S922X devices like the Ugoos AM6b+).

Every invocation needs the same variables: `make`, `./scripts/clean`, `./scripts/build`, all of them. Each PROJECT/DEVICE/ARCH combination is its own build tree, so a bare `./scripts/clean kodi` cleans the Amlogic-ne tree while your image builds in the Amlogic-ng one: you never actually cleaned.

```sh
# release image for Amlogic-ng (arm)
PROJECT=Amlogic-ce DEVICE=Amlogic-ng ARCH=arm make release

# clean/rebuild single packages in that same tree
PROJECT=Amlogic-ce DEVICE=Amlogic-ng ARCH=arm ./scripts/clean kodi
PROJECT=Amlogic-ce DEVICE=Amlogic-ng ARCH=arm ./scripts/build libdovi
```

### Setting the defaults permanently

Export them from your shell so every command agrees:

```sh
# bash: ~/.bashrc — zsh: ~/.zshrc
export PROJECT=Amlogic-ce
export DEVICE=Amlogic-ng
export ARCH=arm
```

```fish
# fish: run once (universal variables), or put in ~/.config/fish/config.fish
set -Ux PROJECT Amlogic-ce
set -Ux DEVICE Amlogic-ng
set -Ux ARCH arm
```

Don't use `~/.coreelec/options` for these three: the build system sources that file after the target defaults are resolved, so `DEVICE=Amlogic-ng` set there still leaves `ARCH=aarch64` and you end up with a broken hybrid build tree. That file is fine for build tweaks like `CONCURRENCY_MAKE_LEVEL`, not for target selection.

### Object audio needs a second, 64-bit pass (Amlogic-ng only)

Kodi renders Dolby Atmos and DTS:X objects to headphones by running the decoder and the spatial renderer in a **64-bit helper process**. That is not a preference: a shared library takes the word size of whoever loads it, and in the 32-bit userspace an Amlogic-ng image ships, the same work costs roughly twice as much — measured on an S922X, Dolby Digital Plus Atmos decodes at 0.419 of realtime in 32-bit against 0.204 in 64-bit.

So on `ARCH=arm` the three 64-bit pieces are built in their own tree first, and the image build copies them in:

```sh
# once, and again whenever omniphony or harletty-bridge moves
PROJECT=Amlogic-ce DEVICE=Amlogic-ng ARCH=aarch64 ./scripts/build omniphony

# then the image as usual
PROJECT=Amlogic-ce DEVICE=Amlogic-ng ARCH=arm make release
```

That one command builds all three — the engine (`omniphony`), the decoder bridge (`harletty-bridge`) and the helper (`omniphony-helper`) — because the first pulls in the other two. It also builds an aarch64 toolchain the first time, which is slow; the arm image build reuses nothing from that tree but the finished objects.

Skipping the pass does not leave you with a quietly broken image: the `omniphony` package stops the build and prints the command above.

**On `ARCH=aarch64` (Amlogic-ne) there is nothing extra to do.** The image is already 64-bit, so one normal build produces everything.

### Local source checkouts (branch `coreelec-21_local`)

Development happens on `coreelec-21_local`; `coreelec-21` carries the release states it is cut from. The core packages of this fork don't download release tarballs. Their `package.mk` points at a local working copy via a `file://` URL, and whatever is checked out there is what gets built. The build never pulls or resets these checkouts, so verify their state before packaging:

| package.mk | builds from local checkout | source repo |
|---|---|---|
| `projects/Amlogic-ce/packages/mediacenter/kodi` | `sources/kodi/xbmc-local` | [pannal/xbmc](https://github.com/pannal/xbmc/) |
| `projects/Amlogic-ce/packages/linux` | `$HOME/linux-amlogic-local` | [pannal/linux-amlogic](https://github.com/pannal/linux-amlogic) |
| `projects/Amlogic-ce/packages/linux-drivers/amlogic/media_modules-aml` | `sources/media_modules-aml/media_modules-aml-local` | [pannal/media_modules-aml](https://github.com/pannal/media_modules-aml) |
| `projects/Amlogic-ce/packages/mediacenter/CoreELEC-settings` | `sources/service.coreelec.settings/service.coreelec.settings-local` | [pannal/service.coreelec.settings](https://github.com/pannal/service.coreelec.settings) |
| `projects/Amlogic-ce/packages/mediacenter/skin.p3i.estuary` | `sources/skin.p3i.estuary/skin.p3i.estuary-local` | bundled skin |

Clone each repo to the listed path (the branch to check out follows from `PKG_VERSION`/`PKG_GIT_BRANCH` in the respective `package.mk`), or edit the `PKG_URL` in those files to point at your own checkouts.

One-time note: the first build also bootstraps the rust toolchain (for `libdovi`), which adds roughly an hour of host compilation. Subsequent builds reuse it.
