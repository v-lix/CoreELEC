# CoreELEC p3i

This is a custom build based on the great work Jamal did with his [U3k line of CE builds](https://github.com/CE-Repo) and by proxy, [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-code), [avdvplus](https://github.com/avdvplus/Builds), and everyone else involved. p3i aims to continue the lineage of U3k by:
* providing a stable daily driver base for especially S922X-based SoC's (Ugoos AM6b+, FireTV Cube 2, ...)
* backporting significant improvements to CoreELEC and Kodi from upstream and other known custom builds
* ensuring full transparency in the development process (all changes are properly committed and comprehensible)
* providing significant performance improvements for complex UIs

p3i doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel, but ultimately, to replace the famous [CPM A14 build](https://github.com/cpm-code/xbmc/releases/tag/CoreELEC-Amlogic-ng.arm-21.2-Omega_20250302082815.A14) as a stable, well maintained, daily driver.

It's directly forked off of [U3k B11](https://github.com/CE-Repo/xbmc/releases/tag/B11), so its core is:
* Kodi Omega 21.3 with significant backports from Kodi 22 upstream
* Python 3.13.11
* FFMPEG 8.0.1
